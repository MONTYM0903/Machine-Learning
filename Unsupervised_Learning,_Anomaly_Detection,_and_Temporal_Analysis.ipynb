        "Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of reducing the number of input variables (features) in a dataset while keeping as much important information as possible. In simple terms, it helps us simplify data by compressing it into fewer meaningful dimensions. When datasets have too many features, the model can become slow, confused, or overfitted. Dimensionality reduction helps solve these problems.\n",

        "To imagine this, think of taking a high-resolution photo with thousands of pixels. If you shrink the image but still keep the important shapes and colors, you have reduced its “dimensions” but preserved the main idea. Machine learning does something similar with data: it compresses the features without losing important patterns.\n",

        "Dimensionality reduction can be done in different ways, and there are several well-known techniques that help simplify datasets. Each method has its own logic and mathematical approach, but the main goal remains the same—represent important information using fewer features. Here are three widely used dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",

        "\n",

        "**2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**\n",

        "\n",
        "t-SNE is useful especially for visualization. It reduces data into two or three dimensions and keeps similar points close while pushing dissimilar points apart.\n",

        "Time series analysis helps detect anomalies by predicting normal behavior and identifying deviations. This is widely used in finance, cybersecurity, machine monitoring, and healthcare. By understanding patterns in the past, time series models can spot unusual or suspicious events quickly and accurately."
